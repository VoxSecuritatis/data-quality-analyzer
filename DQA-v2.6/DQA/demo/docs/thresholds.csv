Check,Threshold / Rule of Thumb,Severity Levels,Notes
Missing Values,"<5% (OK), 5–30% (Warning), >30% (High Risk)","Green <5%, Yellow 5–30%, Red >30%",">30% missing often dropped unless critical"
Duplicate Rows,">1–5% flagged","Green <1%, Yellow 1–5%, Red >5%","Should be 0% for unique IDs"
Outliers (Z-score),"Z > 3 or Z < -3","Count % outliers per column","Standard statistical definition"
Outliers (IQR),"Outside Q1 - 1.5*IQR or Q3 + 1.5*IQR","Count % outliers per column","Robust to non-normal data"
Class Imbalance,"<80/20 OK, 80/20–90/10 Warning, >90/10 Severe","Balanced <80/20, Warning 80–90/10, Red >90/10","Severe imbalance requires resampling"
Correlation,"|r| > 0.9 (strong correlation)","Green <0.85, Yellow 0.85–0.9, Red >0.9","VIF >10 also indicates multicollinearity"
Cardinality (Categorical),"Unique categories >50% of rows","Flagged","Likely ID columns (e.g., user_id)"
Low Variance Features,"Variance ≈ 0 or >99% same value","Flagged","Provides no predictive power"
Invalid Values,"Violates domain/business rules","Flagged","Domain-specific thresholds needed"
Feature Scaling,"Std dev differs >100x between numeric features","Flagged","Suggest normalization / scaling"
Time Series Gaps,"Missing/duplicate timestamps","Flagged","Depends on expected frequency"
